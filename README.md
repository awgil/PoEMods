# PoEMods
Collection of personal mods for Pillars of Eternity 1.

Uses awesome Patchwork framework for patching the game assembly.

When cloning, make sure to include submodules: ```git clone --recurse-submodules url...```

# TODO
CombatDetails:
* Print out details for defense vs. keyword/affliction, rather than grouping them under "Misc"
* Make number formatting prettier?

Misc:
* Find out why Stalker's Torc effect sometimes disappears (and fix it to apply special "stalker's link damage mod" rather than generic "damage mod" effect)
* Find out why enemies sometimes (rarely) stand idle in combat
